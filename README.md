Ianna Gilbert

I am an undergraduate student at Brandeis University who is majoring in 
computer science and environmental studies with a minor in Hispanic 
Studies. As of right now, my future career is in the field of marine 
ecology and I hope to be able to implement technology while conducting 
research in this field of study. I took this course with the intention of 
homing in on my data analysis skills. Some of my hobbies include 
photography, hiking and video editing.
