These are my answers for the Bash section of Assignment 1

1. cd Desktop/Git-Hib/assignments-1
mkdir answers

2. cd answers
touch answers.txt

4. /Users/iannag/Desktop/Git-Hub/assignment-1/answers

5. ls -a

6. In order to use  ls to list the files and folders outside of your 
directory, type  the ls command followed by the file path in which you would like to list the 
files. For example, if I am currently in the Downloads folder and I would 
like to list all of the files in my desktop folder, I would use the 
command ls ~/Desktop. 

7. rm is a dangereous command because the files or folders are not stored 
in the trash bin after deleted. When rm is used, the files or directories 
are deleted forever. One example in which an unintended outcome can be 
warranted is if a person uses the command rm -r Desktop. This command 
would delete the Desktop folder and  all the folders and files on the 
persons desktop. There is no way of recovering those files so the person 
would loose all the content they have on their desktop. 

8. mkdir results

9. cd results
touch my_script.sh
nano my_script.sh 
*paste the code from the assignment-1 pdf

10. chmod 775 my_script.sh

11. cd ~/Desktop/College/Spring2023/ENVS110/assignment-1-main-main/data
*the data folder is in a folder I have dedicated to the class. The 
directory which holds the answers.txt is the one that was pushed to 
git-hub

12. wc -w *.csv |sort -n | tail -n 3 | head -n 1
* I used tail -n 3 because the way in which my code prints, the total is 
the final line so tail -n 1 is the total tail -n 2 is the largest and tail 
-n 3 is the largest two. 

13. nano  anualAqi.sh

*the following code is what I typed into the anualAqi.sh file

#!/usr/bin/env bash

for annual_aqi in *.csv

do

		
	~/Desktop/Git-Hub/assignment-1/answers/results/my_script.sh $annual_aqi 

	echo output:
done 

*I had to run the following code in order to change the permissions of the 
files that I needed to access

chmod 775 anualAqi.sh

for files in *.csv
for> do
for> chmod 775 $files
for> done

./anualAqi.sh

14. mkdir  unzipped-files
mv *.zip unzipped-files
cd unzipped-files
unzip '*.zip'

15. rm *.zip

16. 
 cd unzipped-files
cp annual_aqi_by_county_20??.csv ~/Desktop/Git-Hub/assignment-1/answers/results
